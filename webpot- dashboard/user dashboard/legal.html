            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p class="updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Webpot. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and the web
                development services provided by us. By accessing our website, purchasing a service plan (Starter,
                Basic, or Premium), or signing a contract with us, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h3>2. Services and Scope of Work</h3>
            <p>We provide web development services as described in our packages (Starter, Basic, Premium) or a custom
                proposal.</p>
            <p>"Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" refers to Webpot.</p>
            <p>"Client," "You," or "Your" refers to the entity or individual purchasing services from Webpot.</p>
            <p>"Project" refers to the web development work commissioned by the Client.</p>
            <p>"Deliverables" refers to the finished website, code, and design assets provided to the Client.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The specific deliverables (number of pages, SEO level, design style) are
                    strictly limited to the package selected by the Client.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Creep:</strong> Any additional features, pages, or changes requested by the Client
                    outside the original agreement will incur additional charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Timelines:</strong> Delivery times (e.g., 7 days, 15 days) are estimates. These timelines
                    commence only after we receive all necessary content (images, text, credentials) from the Client.
                    Delays in Client feedback will result in delays in the final delivery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Client Obligations</h3>
            <p>To ensure the successful completion of the Project, you agree to: provide accurate information, respond
                promptly to requests, and maintain communication with Webpot throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

            <h3>4. Payments and Refunds</h3>
            <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> All prices listed on the website are in Indian Rupees (INR) and are billed on a
                <strong>monthly recurring basis</strong> unless otherwise specified.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> A deposit (typically 50%) is required before work begins. The remaining
                balance is due upon project completion but prior to the final website handover/deployment.</p>
            <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you cancel the project before work has begun, you are eligible for a full refund.</li>
                <li>If you cancel the project after work has begun, the initial deposit is non-refundable to cover our
                    time and resources.</li>
                <li>Once the website is deployed/live, no refunds will be issued.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights</h3>
            <p><strong>Client Ownership:</strong> Upon full payment of all invoices, the Client is granted full
                ownership of the finished website code and design.</p>
            <p><strong>Webpot Rights:</strong> We reserve the right to reuse underlying code snippets, libraries, or
                frameworks used in the development process for other projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> You grant Webpot the right to display the finished Project in our portfolio,
                website, and marketing materials as a demonstration of our work.</p>

            <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p><strong>Hosting & Domain:</strong> Unless explicitly stated in a custom contract, the Client is
                responsible for the purchase and renewal of domain names and web hosting.</p>
            <p><strong>Plugins/APIs:</strong> Costs for premium third-party themes, plugins, or APIs (e.g., payment
                gateways) are the responsibility of the Client.</p>

            <h3>7. Warranties and Liability</h3>
            <p><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> While we implement basic SEO and responsive design as per industry
                standards, we do not guarantee specific search engine rankings or sales numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Webpot shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or
                consequential damages, including loss of data, loss of profits, or downtime caused by third-party
                hosting providers or malicious attacks (hacking).</p>
            <h3>8. Termination</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to terminate a project if the Client is unresponsive for more than 30 days, uses
                abusive language, or fails to make payments. In such cases, the deposit is forfeited.</p>
            <h3>9. Contact Information</h3>
